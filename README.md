## Grading System

1 midterm assignment(10%)
1 final assignment(25%)
1 final exam (50%)

The failure of the final assignment of final exam represents the failure of the whole course.

### Absences

* Lab Presence is mandatory, remember to sign the presence sheet every class. If you fail on doing so, 3 unjustified absences automatically fails you.
  * **But I was traveling** Good for you :) But unless you have some justification that is just another absence;
  * **But I was sick** Send a proof of it to the lecturer e-mail;
  * **But I really needed to skip the class** Send your justification to the lecturer's e-mail and the course team will evaluate it.
  * **But I arrived super late in the semester** Once again, send it to the lecturer, this information will be verified with the university administration and the course team will decide each case.
  * **But I was about to sign the presence sheet then I got distracted by a gnome that was passing by the classroom, passed the sheet on and forgot to sign it by the end of the class even though it was there all the time.** Really? OMG! Fortunately you can have 3 absences.


### Copies, plagiarism and similars
Cheating exams or copying other's people work without the appropriate reference will fail you. For such cases there is no second exam chance, no retake, no nothing. In case of a copied exam, both students fail.

Any sort of plagiarism, copies, ideological falsehood (e.g. fake documents)  or unlawful behavior may be subject of auction in the format of the university regulations.
