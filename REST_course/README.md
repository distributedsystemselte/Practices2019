# REST Crash Course

During this sessions we will explore the development of REST Services using Java Jersey as well as the use cases and characteristics.

## Pre-course session
- XML
- JSON
- [If nothing works, go with curl](https://www.baeldung.com/curl-rest)
- Install Postman (or similar)
- Use the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/)
- Use the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) E.gG:

      curl -v https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemons/squirtle

- Installing ant [Windows](https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html),  [Linux](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB450/Installing+Apache+Ant+on+Linux), [Mac](https://www.mkyong.com/ant/how-to-apache-ant-on-mac-os-x/) or w/ [ Brew](http://macappstore.org/ant/)
- Run the basic structure


## Define the REST Project
- Use a Public API
  - [Any API](https://any-api.com/)
  - [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/)
- Produce a Service with at least 3 endpoints that consumes from a third party API at least once.
