# Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

(AKA Remote procedure call (RPC))

Develop an RMI Server that works as a calculator.

Implement the four calculation methods in the server.

Register the same service with two different implementations,

* in the first register it should have an initial value where it has an initial current value
* In the second register it should start with current value zero and the numbers to be calculates must be initialized later
